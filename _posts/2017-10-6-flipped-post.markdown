------------------------
***flipped*** is a very simple story, but very rich. Speaking of children puppy love, in fact, the film also talked about the **pursuit**(追求)of their dreams, respect, hard work, how to look at poverty, how to accept the disabled family, how to maintain their own **self-esteem**(自尊).
《怦然心动》是很简单的故事，但是很丰富。主讲小孩早恋，其实这部电影里还讲了追求自己的梦想，尊重，勤劳，怎么看待贫穷，怎么接纳残障的家人，怎么维护自己的自尊。

>A painting is more than the sum of its parts.A cow by itself is just a cow.A meadow by itself is just grass,flowers.And the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light.But you put them all together and it can be magic.
*一幅画不是众多物件简单拼凑而成的。牛只是一头牛，草地也只有青草和鲜花，而穿过树枝的阳光也仅仅只是一束光，但如果将它们放到一起，就会产生魔法一般的魅力。*<br />

>The higherI got,the more amazedI was by the view.
*我爬得越高，眼前的风景便愈发迷人。*<br />

>Some days the sunsets would be purple and pink.And some days they were a blazing orange setting fire to the clouds on the horizon.It was during one of those sunsets that my father's idea of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts moved from my head to my heart.
*有时落日泛起紫红的余晖，有时散发出橘红色的火光燃起天边的晚霞。在这绚烂的日落景象中，我慢慢领悟了父亲所说的整体胜于局部总和的道理。*

*有些人沦为平庸浅薄，金玉其外，而败絮其中。可不经意间，有一天你会遇到一个彩虹般绚丽的人，从此以后，其他人就不过是匆匆浮云。*<br />
